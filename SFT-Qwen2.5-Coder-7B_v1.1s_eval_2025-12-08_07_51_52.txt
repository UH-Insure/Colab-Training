### Instruction:
Write a Cryptol function that implements the tasks described below.

### Request:
Task: Using the existing type `Cipher` and value `toyCipher` provided in the test setup, define a single polymorphic Cryptol function named `evktest` with the following type:

evktest : {ks, bs, n} (fin bs)
       => (Cipher ks bs, [n]([ks],[bs]), [bs]) -> [n]([bs], Bit)

The function should take a cipher implementation, a sequence of (Key, Ciphertext) test vectors, and a single plaintext block. For each (Key, CT) in the list, it must iterate over that list using a single generator in a list comprehension (no parallel generators or multiple `|` arms), compute CT' = cipher.encrypt Key PT for that entry, and produce an output list of pairs (CT', CT' == CT).

The code for `Cipher` and `toyCipher` is ALREADY present in the file from the test setup code. In your answer, you MUST NOT repeat, modify, or redefine `Cipher` or `toyCipher`, and you MUST NOT add any other top-level declarations.

Your entire answer must consist of exactly two top-level lines: (1) the type signature for `evktest` exactly as given above, and (2) the definition of `evktest`. Do not wrap these in a module declaration, and do not include any setup code.

### Additional setup code:
```cryptol
type Cipher ks bs =

  , decrypt : [ks] -> [bs] -> [bs]

### Instruction:
Write a Cryptol property that tests the function described below.

### Request:
Task: Using ONLY the SHA-512 specification provided in the test setup (which defines a function `sha512` and all supporting constants), define a Cryptol property named `testVector1` with no arguments that checks `sha512` against the following fixed known-answer test vector:

- Message (as a hex literal): 0x616263
- Expected digest (as a hex literal): 0xddaf35a193617abacc417349ae20413112e6fa4e89a97ea20a9eeee64b55d39a2192992a274fc1a836ba3c23a3feebbd454d4423643ce80e2a9ac94fa54ca49f

The property must *exactly* assert that `sha512` of this message equals this digest.

The full definition of `sha512` (and all helper functions and constants) is ALREADY present in the file from the test setup code. In your answer, you MUST NOT repeat, modify, or redefine `sha512` or any of its helpers, and you MUST NOT add any other top-level declarations.

Your entire answer must be a single top-level declaration starting with:

property testVector1 =

and it must directly assert that `sha512 0x616263` equals the given digest, using those exact hex constants. Do not introduce any arguments, do not wrap it in a module, and do not include any setup code.

Return exactly ONE fenced code block labeled `cryptol` and nothing else (no prose before/after).

[USER]
### Instruction:
Write a Cryptol function that implements the tasks described below.

### Request:
Task: Create a Cryptol specification that performs the SHA-512 message schedule expansion. Define the functions `messageSch : [16][64] -> [80][64]`, `sigma0 : [64] -> [64]`, and `sigma1 : [64] -> [64]` to perform the message expansion.

sigma0 : [64] -> [64]
sigma0 x = (x >>> 28) ^ (x >>> 34) ^ (x >>> 39)
sigma1 : [64] -> [64]
