Define the function `evktest : {ks, bs, n} (fin bs) => (Cipher ks bs, [n]([ks],[bs]), [bs]) -> [n]([bs], Bit)`, that takes a cipher, `n` key and test vector tuples, and plain text. The function test that using the cipher’s `encrypt` to encrypt the plain text with each key from the test vectors will produce the cipher text in the test vectors. The function returns `n` tuples containing the cipher text produced by encrypting the plain text with each test key and a boolean value whether the cipher text matches the expected test vector.

### Instruction:
Write a Cryptol function that implements the tasks described below.

### Request:
Task: Using the existing type `Cipher` and value `toyCipher` provided in the test setup, define a single polymorphic Cryptol function named `evktest` with the following type:

evktest : {ks, bs, n} (fin bs)
       => (Cipher ks bs, [n]([ks],[bs]), [bs]) -> [n]([bs], Bit)

The function should take a cipher implementation, a sequence of (Key, Ciphertext) test vectors, and a single plaintext block. For each (Key, CT) in the list, it must iterate over that list using a single generator in a list comprehension (no parallel generators or multiple `|` arms), compute CT' = cipher.encrypt Key PT for that entry, and produce an output list of pairs (CT', CT' == CT).

The code for `Cipher` and `toyCipher` is ALREADY present in the file from the test setup code. In your answer, you MUST NOT repeat, modify, or redefine `Cipher` or `toyCipher`, and you MUST NOT add any other top-level declarations.

Your entire answer must consist of exactly two top-level lines: (1) the type signature for `evktest` exactly as given above, and (2) the definition of `evktest`. Do not wrap these in a module declaration, and do not include any setup code.

### Additional setup code:
```cryptol
type Cipher ks bs =
  { encrypt : [ks] -> [bs] -> [bs]
  , decrypt : [ks] -> [bs] -> [bs]

### Instruction:
Write a Cryptol property that tests the function described below.

### Request:
Task: Using ONLY the SHA-512 specification provided in the test setup (which defines a function `sha512` and all supporting constants), define a Cryptol property named `testVector1` with no arguments that checks `sha512` against the following fixed known-answer test vector:

- Message (as a hex literal): 0x616263
- Expected digest (as a hex literal): 0xddaf35a193617abacc417349ae20413112e6fa4e89a97ea20a9eeee64b55d39a2192992a274fc1a836ba3c23a3feebbd454d4423643ce80e2a9ac94fa54ca49f

The property must *exactly* assert that `sha512` of this message equals this digest.

The full definition of `sha512` (and all helper functions and constants) is ALREADY present in the file from the test setup code. In your answer, you MUST NOT repeat, modify, or redefine `sha512` or any of its helpers, and you MUST NOT add any other top-level declarations.

Your entire answer must be a single top-level declaration starting with:

property testVector1 =

and it must directly assert that `sha512 0x616263` equals the given digest, using those exact hex constants. Do not introduce any arguments, do not wrap it in a module, and do not include any setup code.

### Additional setup code:
```cryptol
sha512 M = result

### Instruction:
Write a Cryptol property that tests the function described below.

### Request:
Task: Using ONLY the definitions `mk_buggy_fib_no_init`, `generate`, the infix operator `$`, and the sequences `foo` and `bar` provided in the test setup, define a Cryptol property named `fooEqualsBar` with no arguments that asserts that `foo` and `bar` are exactly equal. Do not redefine any of these functions or values; only provide the definition of `property fooEqualsBar`.

### Instruction:
Write a Cryptol function that implements the tasks described below.

### Request:
Task: Implement a polymorphic Cryptol function `moddiv_eq` that checks the correctness of modular division over Z p. Use the following type:

moddiv_eq : {p} (prime p, p >= 3) => Z p -> Z p -> Bool

For any prime modulus p, the function must return `True` if the divisor y is zero, or if `(x /. y) * y` equals x in Z p, and `False` otherwise. Use the built-in modular division operator `/.` and logical disjunction `\/?`. Do not define any other top-level bindings; only provide the type signature for `moddiv_eq` and its body.

Write a Cryptol function that implements the tasks described below.

### Request:
Task: Write a Cryptol file that defines the functions `mk_curve_ops`, `ec_v1`, and `ec_v2`. The definition must follow the exact structure shown in the prompt: `mk_curve_ops` must construct a record containing fields `field`, `v1`, and `v2`, where `v1` calls `ec_v1` on the input parameter and `v2` calls `ec_v2` on the record being constructed. The functions must use the polymorphic types exactly as shown and must access `p.field.v0` correctly in `ec_v2`. The file must contain no module declaration and must consist only of the three definitions.

[PROMPT END]

[GENERATED BEGIN]
```cryptol
mk_curve_ops p =
  { field = p
  , v1 x = ec_v1 p x
  , v2 x = ec_v2 (mk_curve_ops p) x
  }

ec_v1 p x =
  p.field.v0

ec_v2 ops x =
  ops.field.v0 + x

### Instruction:
Write a Cryptol function that implements the tasks described below.

### Request:
Task: Write a Cryptol module named `T038` that declares an interface submodule `I` providing `x : [8]`, a submodule `F` that imports interface submodule `I` and defines `y = x + 1`, a submodule `P` that imports submodule `F` while exposing submodule `Q`, a submodule `Q` that defines `x = 11`, and finally an interface submodule `J` that imports submodule `F` through `P`. The structure must match the Cryptol module system rules exactly.

### Instruction:
Write a Cryptol function that implements the tasks described below.

### Request:
Task: Reproduce exactly the four foreign function declarations `foreignAndCryptol`, `foreignAndNoCryptol`, `noForeignAndCryptol`, and `noForeignAndNoCryptol`, each using the C calling convention. Implement `foreignAndCryptol` to return its argument unchanged, leave `foreignAndNoCryptol` unimplemented, implement `noForeignAndCryptol` to return `x + 3`, and leave `noForeignAndNoCryptol` unimplemented. The file must contain only these four declarations.

### Instruction:
Write a Cryptol property that tests the function described below.

### Request:
Task: Write a Cryptol module implementing parameterized AES encryption and decryption for key sizes 128, 192, and 256 bits. The module must import the AES algorithm, key expansion, and T-box modules exactly as specified, define `encrypt` and `decrypt` in terms of expanded keys, and include a property named `test` verifying that `decrypt k (encrypt k pt) == pt` for all valid keys and all 128-bit plaintexts.

=== Task 23 ===

[PROMPT BEGIN]
[SYSTEM]
Return exactly ONE fenced code block labeled `cryptol` and nothing else (no prose before/after).

[USER]
### Instruction:
Write a Cryptol property that tests the function described below.

### Request:
Task: Write a complete Cryptol module implementing the Bivium stream cipher. The module must define `Bivium_stream`, `Bivium`, `Bivium_alt`, and all cycle-testing helpers. It must also define the four properties: `Bivium_correct`, `Bivium_search`, `Bivium_search_with_suffix`, and `Bivium_alt_equivalent`, using the exact IVs, suffix, and test keystream provided. The file must match the structure and behavior of the Bivium specification.
