It must pad the message per SHA-512 (append a single 1 bit, then zero bits, then a 128-bit big-endian length) so that the total length is a multiple of 1024, with the usual bound that the original length fits in 128 bits. After padding, split into 1024-bit blocks, iteratively apply a compression function starting from an 8-word 64-bit initial vector, and return the final chaining value concatenated into 512 bits. (2) A function processBlock with type [1024] -> [8][64] -> [8][64] that builds an 80-word schedule from the 16 input words and performs 80 rounds of the SHA-512 step, then adds the result to the incoming state word-wise modulo 2^64. (3) A function step with type [8][64] -> [64] -> [8] -> [8][64] that takes the state, a 64-bit schedule word, and a round index in [0..79], computes T1 and T2 using the SHA-512 Ch, Maj, and big-sigma functions, and returns the next state. (4) A function messageSch with type [16][64] -> [80][64] that defines words 16..79 using the small-sigma recurrences. (5) A polymorphic pad with constraints capturing the SHA-512 padding length arithmetic and output length multiple-of-1024 requirement. (6) Bitwise helpers Ch, Maj, SIGMA0, SIGMA1, sigma0, sigma1 on 64-bit words using rotates and shifts. (7) Constants H0 : [8][64] and K : [80][64] with standard SHA-512 initialization and round constants. (8) A property named testVector1 that checks the hash of a specific hexadecimal message equals a specific 512-bit hexadecimal digest (the property may ignore its argument).
